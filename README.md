## Setup vim
First you need to install vundle: 
`git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`

Copy or symlink `.vimrc` file inside dotfiles directory to your $HOME directory
E.g `ln -s ./dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc`

Then open vim, run command `:PluginInstall` to install listed plugins

If you want to want to use custom configuration, create `.vimrc.local` in your $HOME directory

My `.vimrc` file is well commented (I guess) so I recommend you to read it, and feel free to contact me if you have any question.

## Setup tmux
All configuration does not need any aditional action, except for the plugin

To use plugin: install tmux plugin manager (Optional)

Git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm

In tmux session, `prefix + I` to install listed plugins
